# Data Science

## Setting up the environment
To use virtual environment with jupyter notebooks you need to:
1. make sure you are in the project directory
2. create virtual environment `python3 -m venv env`
3. activate environment `source env/bin/activate`
4. install requirements `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. install kernel `python -m ipykernel install --name DataScience`
6. launch jupyter notebook `jupyter-notebook`
7. after you are done - deactivate environment `deactivate`


## Data Science Process

1. Define
    - Define the problem - What are the KPIs? How the solution is going to make the company more successful?
2. Discover
    - Obtain data
    - Clean data
    - Explore data
    - Establish baseline outcomes
    - Hypothesize solutions
3. Develop
    - Engineer features
    - Create models
    - Test models
    - Select best model
4. Deploy
    - Automate pipeline
    - Deploy solution
    - Measure efficacy
